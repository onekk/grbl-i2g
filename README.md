# grbl-i2g
Fork of dmap2gcode optimized for grbl and with some improvement in path control and speed.

I hope it will be an improvement useful for some other people than me.

But it is developed primarily for my workflow and for my preference in machining (only cut per row in positive movement as my spindle dind't like climb cutting and chatter a lot and the manual say NO climb milling).

Many thanks to Scorch the great guy who create dmap2gcode for releasing the software with GPL-3.
